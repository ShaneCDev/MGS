# MGS - Movies, Games, Shows

This is a website for anyone who want's something to watch or play without scrolling through Netflix or Steam or the Playstation store for hours on end, instead they just come here and they have a plethora of options to choose from. The main purpose of the website is to save some arguments and debates in the household about what piece of media they want to indulge in, and there is a little description of every item on the website just incase people don't want to watch the trailer they just can just read and pick whatever tickles their fancy and go from there.

# 5. Surface
- ## Colour
![Colour Palette](/assets/img/readmeimgs/screenshots/colourpalette.png)

The colour palette is based on dark themes that are commonplace on websites nowadays. It really is just a quite simple and really clean colour palette in my opinion and I think it works really well.

- ## Font
---
'Roboto Condensed' and 'Cabin' fonts are used for this website and were imported from Google fonts.

- # Future Implementation
    - I would use javascript as I believe that I could add a lot more functionality to the site and I would just overall have more freedom to add features.


# Deployment
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages:
1. Go into a repository, click on Settings.
2. Click on GitHub Pages.
3. Click on branches and select "main" from the dropdown.
4. Once "main" is selected, the page will be refreshed automatically and the page will indicate successful deployment and the link will appear.
5. Further changes will be automatically deployed to the live site using the "git push" command from the development environment.

The website can be viewed here. [MGS](https://shanecdev.github.io/MGS/index.html)
