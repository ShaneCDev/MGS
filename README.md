# MGS - Movies, Games, Shows
---
This is a website for anyone who want's something to watch or play without scrolling through Netflix or Steam or the Playstation store for hours on end, instead they just come here and they have a plethora of options to choose from. The main purpose of the website is to save some arguments and debates in the household about what piece of media they want to indulge in, and there is a little description of every item on the website just incase people don't want to watch the trailer they just can just read and pick whatever tickles their fancy and go from there.
